This error occurs when using the FlatList component in React Native and providing an incorrect `keyExtractor` function.  The `keyExtractor` is crucial for efficient rendering and updates of list items. If you don't provide one, or if it doesn't return a unique key for each item, you'll get this warning or may experience unexpected behavior such as incorrect item updates or deletions.

```javascript
//Incorrect keyExtractor
<FlatList
  data={myData}
  renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.text}</Text>}
/>
```

The above example will fail because it doesn't provide a `keyExtractor` function.
